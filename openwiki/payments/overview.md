# Payments

Startline uses **Stripe Connect Express** for organiser payouts. Athletes pay via Stripe PaymentIntents, and platform fees are collected as part of each transaction.

## Stripe Configuration

- **API version**: `2026-05-27.dahlia` (set in `/lib/stripe.ts`)
- **Singleton client**: `getStripe()` returns a cached `Stripe` instance
- **Secret key**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` environment variable

## Platform Fee

Defined in `/lib/platform-fee.ts`:

- **Rate**: 3.95% + $1.45 AUD per registration (flat fee)
- **Fee structure**: The `feeStructure` field on `Event` and `Registration` determines who pays:
  - `"athlete"` — fee is added on top of the ticket price (default)
  - `"organiser"` — fee is deducted from the organiser's payout
- All money is handled in **integer cents** (AUD)

## Checkout Flow

The checkout API at `/app/api/checkout/route.ts`:

1. Validates the event exists and is open for registration
2. Normalises participant data (single or group)
3. Validates age (18+), required fields, and emergency contact
4. Checks capacity against event cap and per-tier (wave) limits
5. Verifies guest emails if the athlete is not logged in
6. Calculates pricing: ticket sum + platform fee per participant
7. Creates Stripe PaymentIntent and Prisma Registration records
8. Returns client secret for Stripe Elements to confirm payment

Supports:
- **Single registration**: One participant, direct form fields
- **Group registration**: Up to 10 participants (`MAX_REGISTRATION_PARTICIPANTS`), optional shared emergency contact, mixed ticket tiers

## Stripe Connect Express

- Organisers create a Stripe Connect Express account during onboarding
- Startline stores only the `stripeAccountId` reference — bank details are held by Stripe (ToS §3.3)
- `stripeOnboardingComplete` flag tracks whether the organiser finished onboarding
- Payouts flow through Connect to the organiser's bank account

## Registration Capacity

Capacity is checked at checkout time in `/lib/registration-capacity.ts`:

- **Event cap**: Overall limit across all tiers
- **Wave (tier) caps**: Per-ticket-tier limits
- Only **confirmed (paid)** registrations count toward capacity
- A race condition exists for concurrent in-flight payments near the cap — no reservation/hold system is currently implemented
